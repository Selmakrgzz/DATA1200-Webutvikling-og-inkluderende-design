    <h1>1.0 Wold Wide Web</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents<br>
       and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),<br>
       which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the<br>
       Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software<br>
       application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World<br>
       Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon<br>
       which technologies the Web is built.
    </p>

    <h2>1.1 History</h2>
    <p>
        The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext<br>
        Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS).<br>
        Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was described in the<br>
        1945 essay "As We May Think".[12] Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility<br>
        by the second half of the 1980s.[13] By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System<br>
        (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and<br>
        North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.[14]

    <h2>1.2 Function</h2>
    <p>The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not<br>
        mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the World Wide Web<br>
        is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using<br>
        HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.[41]
    </p>

    <h3>1.2.1 HTML</h3>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.<br>
       With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[43]
     </p>

     <h3>1.2.2 Linking</h3>
     <p>
        Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents,<br>
        definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:
        <a href="http://example.org/home.html"> Example.org Homepage</a>
     </p>

     <h3>1.2.3 WWW prefix</h3>
     <p>
        Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet<br>
        hosts according to the services they provide. The hostname of a web server is often www, in the same way that it may<br>
        be ftp for an FTP server, and news or nntp for a Usenet news server.
     </p>

     <h1>2.0 Internet</h1>
     <p>
        The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol<br>
        suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private,<br>
        public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic,<br>
        wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services,<br>
        such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
     </p>

     <h2>2.1 Terminology</h2>
     <p>
        The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven.[7] The word Internet was used in<br>
        1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.[8] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of<br>
        interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[9]
     </p>

     <h2>2.2 History</h2>
     <p>
        In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense funded research<br>
        into time-sharing of computers.[14][15][16] Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies,<br>
        started in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965.[1][17] After the Symposium<br>
        on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network was incorporated into the design<br>
        for the ARPANET and other resource sharing networks such as the Merit Network and CYCLADES, which were developed in the<br>
        late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]
